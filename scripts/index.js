// Declaring Variables

//To declare (create) a variable, just type the wor var and the variable name 

var numberOfKittens; //camelCase is pest practice when naming variables
//It is a good idea to give your variable a starting value. This is called initializing the variable. 
var numberOfKittens = 5;

//with latest version of Javascript ES2015ES6) there is also LET and CONST

//let is simialr is similar to var, but you cannot redclare let variables
let numberOfKittens;
//Const will often remain the same after it has been populated.
const numberOfKittens = 5;

/*Naming variables is case sensitive-camelCase preferred
Variable names need to start with a letter, dollar sign $ or underscore_
Avoid reserved words
Choose clarity and meaning for humans to read later
*/ 

console.log(numberOfKittens);
